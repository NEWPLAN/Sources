## [Declaration](#Menu)
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this section, i am going to add some src here, as far now, there are link list compile design ARP spoofing and IPSEC, each folder contains a different src respectively.</p>

<h2 align="center">this is the basic structure of this folders.</h2>

<a name="C_LINKlisted_info"></a>
## [C_LINKlisted_info](./C_LINKlistd_info)
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C link list info is a simple example to show the useage of pointer and link list of C programming language, we present a new structure to store students info and show them in terminator.</p>

<a name="compile_design_and_tools"></a>
## [compile_design_and_tools](./compile_design_and_tools)
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this folder, you will see some simple example about compiler design and implementation, including the preprocessing, lex analysis and syntax analysis. There are two methods show you how to deal with different kind of style of synatax in syntay anaysis module.</p>

<a name="detecting_ARP_spoofing_based_on_SDN"></a>
## [detecting_ARP_spoofing_based_on_SDN](./detecting_ARP_spoofing_based_on_SDN)
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all known, in a SDN networking system, all switch will packet-in unknown packet to the controller, and it will receive packet from controller, in an ARP spoofing scenario, attacker will packet an spoofed packet to switch, hoping switch packet them out, however, we can analysis it identity in controller module, since switch will packet all unknown packet to controller.</p>

<a name="IPSEC"></a>
## [IPSEC](./IPSEC)
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IPSEC is a novel method to encrypt an pscket stream, including AH ESP method, besides, it contains two different module: tunnel module and transport module for different scinario.</p>

<a name="IPV6_DETECTION"></a>
## [IPV6_DETECTION](./IPV6_DETECTION)
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IPV6_DETECTION is a mini project to detect the deployment of IPV6 in the current Internet, we choose top 100M most popular domain, to find whether each of them has provided a ipv6 service, for each supporting ipv6, then test the connect time and fetch \(htmls\) time.</p>

<a name="combinatoric"></a>
## [combinatoric](./combinatoric)
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;combinatoric is a small project to test the complexity of time and space, including permutation.</p>
